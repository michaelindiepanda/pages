      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Trello Moments ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our
        practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive through our Chrome
        extension, Trello Moments.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>Our extension collects minimal data to function properly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Preferences:</strong> We store your chosen settings locally, including:
          <ul>
            <li>Your preferred image category (emojis, food, motivation)</li>
            <li>Display duration settings</li>
            <li>Screen position preferences</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>The information we collect is used solely to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the core functionality of displaying celebration cards</li>
        <li>Save your preferences for future use</li>
        <li>Improve the extension's performance and user experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>
        All user preferences are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. We do not transmit or store
        any of your data on external servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our extension does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics platforms. All functionality is
        self-contained within the extension.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. Since all data is stored locally, it is
        protected by your browser's built-in security features.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You have the right to:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Modify your settings at any time</li>
        <li>Clear all stored data by uninstalling the extension</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        Our extension is not specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under 13.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
        privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
