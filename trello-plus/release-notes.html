            <p>New Feature - Auto List Collapse, Bug Fixes</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Auto List Collapse
                <ul>
                  <li>When enabled, if a list is empty, then it will collapse automatically.</li>
                  <li>
                    Sticky lists will still take priority over this, e.g. if you have manually collapsed the list in the
                    past, then it will remain collapsed, even if the feature is disabled.
                  </li>
                  <li>Off by default but you can enable and disable this in the extension popup.</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed the issue with the visibility of the cards where lists and cards not visible in the viewport when
                becoming visible where not formatting properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed the issue with the work in progress limit where the color was not being removed when the limit was
                removed from the list name.

                Thanks to BeachingLifing on Reddit for finding the issue with the card visibility. Much appreciated!
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>The issue:</strong> If one had a long list of cards, the cards at the bottom were not showing
                the ID, age or estimation.
                <br />
                <br />
                This would also affect users who had several lists where one had to scroll right to see those lists.
                Again the card information would not show when visible.
                <br />
                <br />
                The knock on effect is that the total estimation and completed estimation fields were incorrect.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have applied a solution, so let's see how we go.
              </li>
              <li>
                We are also releasing a new feature that allows you to set a work in progress limit.
                <br />
                <br />
                If one adds a card limit to the name of the list then the list background will change if the number of
                cards in the list is greater than the limit. The color can be selected from the extension popup.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Example:</strong> (4) My List Name
                <br />
                <br />
                If you have 4 cards in the list and then add a 5th card, the list background will change.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <tr>
          <td>1.5.0</td>
          <td>17 November 2024</td>
          <td>
            <p>Added Estimation Fields</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Decided to add fields to the back of the card to allow for more flexibility in how you use estimation
              </li>
              <li>
                You can now add whole or decimal numbers to the completed and total fields on the back of the card
              </li>
              <li>
                This will automatically add the estimation to the card title. Once your estimate is in the card title
                you can close the back of the card
              </li>
              <li>All data (estimates) are stored with Trello</li>
            </ul>

              <li>
                Still not too sure about the observer pattern, but it's a start, tried to make sure it closes properly
                to prevent memory leaks
