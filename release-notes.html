                            <li>Decided to add fields to the back of the card to allow for more flexibility in how you use estimation</li>
                            <li>You can now add whole or decimal numbers to the completed and total fields on the back of the card</li>
                            <li>This will automatically add the estimation to the card title. Once your estimate is in the card title you can close the back of the card</li>
                            <li>All data (estimates) are stored with Trello</li>
