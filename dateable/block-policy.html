      <h1>Block Policy for Dateable</h1>
      <p><em>Last updated: October 9, 2025</em></p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Dateable is committed to maintaining a safe and respectful community for all users. Our Block Policy is
        designed to protect users from harassment, abuse, and other inappropriate behavior. When users repeatedly
        receive blocks from other members, this may indicate problematic conduct that requires review.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Automatic Account Suspension</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure community safety, accounts may be automatically suspended when they reach certain block thresholds.
        These thresholds are designed to identify patterns of behavior that negatively impact other users.
      </p>
      <p>Your account will be automatically suspended if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You receive more than 10 blocks within 1 day</li>
        <li>You receive 20 or more blocks within 3 days</li>
        <li>You receive 30 or more blocks within 5 days</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. What Happens When Your Account is Suspended</h2>
      <p>
        When your account is automatically suspended due to exceeding block thresholds, the following process occurs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your account access is immediately restricted</li>
        <li>You will receive a notification explaining the reason for suspension</li>
        <li>Your account is assigned to a staff member for manual review</li>
        <li>A member of our Trust and Safety team will investigate the blocks and related activity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Staff Review Process</h2>
      <p>
        Once your account is assigned to a staff member, they will conduct a thorough review that may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Examining the reasons users blocked your account</li>
        <li>Reviewing your profile content and messages</li>
        <li>Checking for violations of our Terms and Conditions and Community Guidelines</li>
        <li>Evaluating your overall conduct on the platform</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The review process typically takes 3-5 business days. In complex cases, additional time may be required.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Appeal Process</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe your account was suspended in error or you wish to provide additional context, you have the
        right to appeal the decision.
      </p>
      <p>To submit an appeal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the Dateable app</li>
        <li>Navigate to the suspension notification</li>
        <li>Select "Submit an Appeal"</li>
        <li>Provide a clear explanation of why you believe the suspension should be reconsidered</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Appeals are reviewed by our Trust and Safety team within 5-7 business days. You will be notified of the
        outcome via the app and email.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Possible Outcomes</h2>
      <p>After the review process, your account may be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reinstated:</strong> If the review determines the blocks were not related to policy violations, your account will be restored with full access</li>
        <li><strong>Reinstated with a Warning:</strong> Your account is restored, but you receive a formal warning about future conduct</li>
        <li><strong>Temporarily Suspended:</strong> Your account remains suspended for a specified period (e.g., 7, 14, or 30 days)</li>
        <li><strong>Permanently Banned:</strong> In cases of severe or repeated violations, your account may be permanently removed from the platform</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Preventing Account Suspension</h2>
      <p>To avoid having your account suspended, we recommend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treating all users with respect and kindness</li>
        <li>Reading and following our Community Guidelines and Terms and Conditions</li>
        <li>Respecting boundaries when other users indicate disinterest</li>
        <li>Ensuring your profile content and messages are appropriate</li>
        <li>Not engaging in harassment, spam, or other prohibited behavior</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. False or Malicious Blocking</h2>
      <p>
        We recognize that the block feature can be misused. Our staff review process is designed to identify patterns
        of coordinated or malicious blocking. If we determine that blocks against your account were made in bad faith,
        appropriate action will be taken against those accounts.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about our Block Policy or need assistance with a suspended account, please contact our
        Trust and Safety team.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Policy Updates</h2>
      <p>
        Dateable reserves the right to modify this Block Policy at any time. Material changes will be communicated
        through the app. Continued use of the app after policy updates constitutes acceptance of the
        revised policy.
