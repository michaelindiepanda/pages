      <h1>Block and Suspension Policy for Dateable</h1>
      <p><em>Last updated: October 9, 2025</em></p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Dateable is committed to maintaining a safe and respectful community for all users. Our Block and Suspension Policy is
        designed to protect users from harassment, abuse, and other inappropriate behavior. When users repeatedly
        receive blocks from other members, this may indicate problematic conduct that requires review.
      </p>
      <p>All suspensions require a <strong>human review</strong> process.</p>

      <h2>2. How Blocks Lead to Automatic Suspension</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure community safety, accounts may be automatically suspended when they reach certain block thresholds.
        These thresholds are designed to identify patterns of behavior that negatively impact other users.
      </p>
      <p>Your account will be automatically suspended if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You receive more than 10 blocks within 1 day</li>
        <li>You receive 20 or more blocks within 3 days</li>
        <li>You receive 30 or more blocks within 5 days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When your account is automatically suspended due to exceeding block thresholds, your account access is immediately restricted,
        your account status will show that you are suspended, and your account is assigned to a staff member for manual review.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Types of Violations and Suspension Policies</h2>
      <p>
        Suspensions can result from exceeding block thresholds or from specific policy violations identified during review.
        The type and duration of suspension depends on the nature of the violation.
      </p>
